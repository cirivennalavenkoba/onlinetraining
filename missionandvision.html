    <h1 class="h1">Mission and Vision : </h1>
      <p class="p">  Along with strategic planning, mission and vision statements are among the most widely used tools, and consistently rank above average in satisfaction.</p>
      <p class="p">A Mission Statement defines the company’s business, its objectives and its approach to reach those objectives. A Vision Statement describes the desired future position of the company. Elements of Mission and Vision Statements are often combined to provide a statement of the company’s purposes, goals and values. However, sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably.

    <h3>how to create a Mission Statements</h3>
    <p class="p">following given below steps</p> <br>
        <h4>Step 1: Develop Your Winning Idea </h4>
        <p class="p">First, identify your organization's "winning idea," or unique selling proposition (USP). This is the idea or approach that makes your organization stand out from its competitors, and it is the reason that customers come to you and not your competitors.        </p>
        <h4>Step 2: Clarify Your Goal </h4>
        <p class="P">Next, make a short list of the most important measures of success for this idea. <br><br>
            For instance, if your winning idea is to create cutting-edge products in a particular industry, how will you know when you've accomplished this goal? If your idea is to provide excellent customer service in an area, what key performance indicator  will let you know that your customers are truly satisfied?<br><br>
            You don't have to include exact figures here, but it's important to have a general idea of what success looks like, so that you know when you've achieved it.<br><br>
            Combine your winning idea and success measures into a general, but measurable goal . Refine the words until you have a concise statement that expresses your ideas, measures and a desired result.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>Step 1: Find the Human Value in Your Work </h4>
        <p class="p">First, identify your organization's mission. Then uncover the real, human value in that mission. For example, how does your organization improve people's lives? How do you make the world a better place?
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 2: Distill Into Values</h4>
                    <p class="p">Next, identify what you, your customers and other stakeholders value the most about how your organization will achieve this mission. Distill these into values  that your organization has, or should have.<br>
                        Some examples of values include excellence, integrity, teamwork, originality, equality, honesty, freedom, service, and strength.
